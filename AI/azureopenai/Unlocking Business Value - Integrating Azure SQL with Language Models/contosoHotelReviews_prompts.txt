Prompt 1:

How many rude feedback comments are there in the hotel review?

Azure OpenAI your own data setting
	‚ñ∫ retrieved documents:
	v In the context of Azure OpenAI, ‚Äúretrieved documents‚Äù refers to the number of document chunks provided to the large language model for formulating the final response1. The number can be set to 3, 5, 10, or 201.
	v This is important because these retrieved documents serve as the grounding data for the AI model. They provide the context and information that the model uses to generate its responses. For example, if you‚Äôre using Azure OpenAI to search an enterprise knowledge base, the retrieved documents could be the search results that are presented as the answer to the search query2.
	v By adjusting the number of retrieved documents, you can control the amount of information that the model has access to when formulating its responses. This can help optimize the model‚Äôs performance based on your specific use case. 
		‚ñ∫ Make sure you increase the retrieved documents to 20 and re send "Prompt 1" again and notice all 6 negative rude feedback showup.
		
	‚ñ∫ strictness
	v You‚Äôre welcome! In the context of Azure OpenAI, ‚Äústrictness‚Äù is a parameter that can be set between 1 and 5. It determines the system‚Äôs aggressiveness in filtering search documents based on their similarity scores. A higher strictness value means a higher threshold for relevance, filtering out more less-relevant documents for responses. This allows you to control the relevance of the documents used to generate responses, optimizing the model‚Äôs performance based on your specific use case and ensuring the responses are as relevant and accurate as possible. üòä
