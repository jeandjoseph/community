Welcome to the Microsoft Autogen Workshop: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Agentic AI
</h1>

This beginner-level, 8-hour workshop is designed for anyone curious about getting started with Agentic AI in the world of data. Whether you're a data engineer, analyst, or simply exploring how AI can support smarter decisions, this session will guide you through the basics. 

You'll learn what Agentic AI is, how it can automate tasks and improve data workflows, and get hands-on experience using tools like Microsoft Autogen and Crew AI. No prior experience with Agentic AI is needed‚Äîjust a willingness to learn and explore how these technologies can make your work more efficient and innovative.



## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Your Environment Ready

üß∞ Before diving into the workshop, let‚Äôs set up your Python environment and install the required libraries.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Prerequisite:** Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any similar IDE installed before proceeding with the virtual environment setup.
  * If the link doesn‚Äôt work, you can download VS Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

üñ•Ô∏è To set up your environment, simply copy and paste the commands into your terminal‚Äîwhether you're using VS Code, Terminal, or any other IDE.


#### üêç 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv autogenv5
.\autogenv5\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # For PowerShell on Windows
# Or use the appropriate activation command for your OS/shell
```

#### ‚ö° 2. Activate Your Python Virtual Environment
 - For PowerShell on Windows
 - Or use the appropriate activation command for your OS/shell
```bash
python -m venv autogenv5
.\autogenv5\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### üì¶ 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai,azure]"
pip install python-dotenv
pip install autogen_agentchat
pip install nest_asyncio
pip install tiktoken
```

Before we dive into the complexities of agentic AI, let‚Äôs start with the simplest and most powerful agent: the human. Using Microsoft AutoGen, we can directly interact with an AI model‚Äîsending messages, receiving responses, and participating in the agent loop, just like any other autonomous agent in the system.
