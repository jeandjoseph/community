Microsoft AutoGen Multi-Agent Dynamic Multi-Turn Conversation
</h1>
### üß† Designing Agentic AI: A Quick Tip

When building agentic AI systems with Microsoft AutoGen, it's important to think carefully about **how and when your agents should stop talking**. Parameters like `max_turns` and `TextMentionTermination` aren‚Äôt just technical details‚Äîthey shape the flow, clarity, and usefulness of your conversations.

‚úÖ Use `max_turns` to keep things bounded and predictable. max_turns creates a fixed multi-turn conversation ‚Äî think of it as a scripted exchange where the number of turns is predetermined. This is great for controlled demos or predictable agent behavior. 

üîÑ Use `TextMentionTermination` when you want the conversation to end naturally based on content. The dialogue continues until a specific condition (like a keyword) is met. This allows for more flexible, goal-driven interactions.

Choosing the right strategy helps ensure your agents behave in a way that‚Äôs both intelligent and intentional.

### üéØ **Demo Focus: Exploring Agent Roles and Termination Strategies**

This demo focuses on how agent roles and termination strategies affect conversation flow in Microsoft AutoGen. 

Let‚Äôs take it a step further by adding a third agent‚Äîa moderator‚Äîwhile still keeping the conversation under a **Fixed Multi-Turn Conversation** setup.

#
Our first demo focuses on a deterministic AutoGen conversation with a **Fixed Multi-Turn** Conversation.

#### ‚úÖ Steps to follow:
1. Copy and paste the code into a Python file, and save it: example - autogen_demo3_run.py
2. Activate your Python virtual environment to ensure dependencies are correctly managed.
3. Run the script using the terminal: Observe how the agents communicate in a fixed multi-turn conversation with deterministic sequencing.

Pay close attention to how the dialogue flows and how it ends predictably after the set number of turns. Below, you‚Äôll find a modified version of the script that shifts to a **Dynamic Multi-Turn Conversation**, where the conversation ends based on content rather than a fixed count.

```


### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Modified in the Dynamic Version

This demo focuses on enabling **Dynamic Multi-Turn Conversation** using a content-based stopping condition.

Here‚Äôs what we changed:
- ‚úÖ Imported the termination condition:
  ```python
  from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination
  ```

‚úÖ Added a termination rule to the RoundRobinGroupChat: 
`termination_condition = TextMentionTermination(text="TERMINATE")`

### üëÄ What to Watch For

As you run this version, observe how the conversation flows more naturally. Instead of stopping abruptly after a fixed number of turns, the agents continue interacting until the keyword `"TERMINATE"` is mentioned. This creates a more flexible and realistic dialogue‚Äîcloser to how real conversations unfold.

### üß© To Summarize

This demo walked you through the two core conversation strategies in Microsoft AutoGen: **Fixed Multi-Turn**, which uses `max_turns` for predictable, structured exchanges, and **Dynamic Multi-Turn**, which leverages `TextMentionTermination` for more natural, context-aware dialogue. Each approach serves different goals whether you're aiming for control or flexibility in agent behavior.

üôè We hope you found this experience insightful! If you enjoyed the demo or learned something new, feel free to share your satisfaction and feedback‚Äîit helps us make future sessions even better.
