Microsoft AutoGen Multi-Agent Dynamic Multi-Turn Conversation Chatbot Application
</h1>

This part of the AI agent demo showcases how to integrate agentic AI into a chatbot application using Microsoft AutoGen and Streamlit. The backend script sets up a debate between three AI agents‚ÄîJean (a Data Engineer), Daniel (an AI Engineer), and a Moderator‚Äîusing AutoGen's AssistantAgent and RoundRobinGroupChat classes. 

These agents interact in a structured, turn-based conversation moderated by predefined rules. The frontend, built with Streamlit, provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a debate topic and watch the conversation unfold in real time. This demo highlights how to orchestrate multi-agent interactions and stream their outputs dynamically in a web app.


#### ‚úÖ Steps to follow:
1. Copy and paste below codes into a Python file, and save it as: `ai_agent_debating.py`
2. Copy and paste below codes into a Python file, and save it as: `agent-app-chat-without-state.py`
3. Activate your Python virtual environment to ensure dependencies are correctly managed.
   
4. Run the script using the terminal

Now let us get started with Step 1: 
   1. Copy and paste below codes into a Python file, and save it as: `ai_agent_debating.py`

    return team

2. Copy and paste below codes into a Python file, and save it as: `agent-app-chat-without-state.py`

````python
import streamlit as st

        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
````
2. Activate your Python virtual environment to ensure dependencies are correctly managed.
   
3. Run the script using the terminal: example: 
   ````python
   streamlit run .\agent-app-chat-without-state.py 
   ````
