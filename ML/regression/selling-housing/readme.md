### 🧠 Series Summary: Fabric ML Lifecycle (Four‑Part Series)

Across this four‑part series, we explored the full **Microsoft Fabric Machine Learning Lifecycle** from foundational strategy to production‑ready deployment.

#### [Part 1 — Problem Framing & Model Selection](https://www.techinsightgroup.com/blg-fabric-ml-success-strategies-from-start-2-finish-part-1.html)
Key contributions:
- Defined how to properly frame an ML problem  
- Validated when machine learning is the right tool  
- Selected the appropriate model family based on business and data context  

This stage established the strategic foundation for the entire lifecycle.

---

#### [Part 2 — Data Quality, Structure & Readiness](https://www.techinsightgroup.com/blg-fabric-ml-success-strategies-from-start-2-finish-part-2.html)
Key contributions:
- Assessed data quality, completeness, and structure  
- Identified readiness gaps and feature engineering needs  
- Reinforced the principle that *no model can outperform the data it learns from*  

Together, Parts 1 and 2 created the technical and strategic groundwork for experimentation.

---

#### [Part 3 — Model Training, Evaluation & Registration](https://www.techinsightgroup.com/blg-fabric-ml-success-strategies-from-start-2-finish-part-3.html)
Key contributions:
- Trained models using structured, repeatable experimentation  
- Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated performance  
- Registered the final model for governance, lineage, and reproducibility  

This phase transformed experimentation into a **traceable, production‑aligned workflow**.

---

#### [Part 4 — Batch Scoring, Prediction & Operationalization](https://www.techinsightgroup.com/blg-fabric-ml-success-strategies-from-start-2-finish-part-4.html)
Key contributions:
- Operationalized the trained model through scalable batch scoring  
- Aligned features for inference and generated predictions  
- Reconstructed human‑readable outputs and stored results for downstream analytics  

This final step turned the model into a **practical, repeatable asset** ready for real‑world use.
